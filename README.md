# knowledge-retrieval

Thesis Project Master of Science Uni WÃ¼rzburg.

The module leverages retrieval augmented generation techniques to retrieve relevant context from documents by natural language queries. The approach is based on Quarkus, AzureOpenAI, and the pgvector extension for PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
- Git installed for cloning the repository.

## Overview

This project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate three main services:

- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Stores document data and conversation sessions.
- **pgAdmin**: Provides a web interface for managing the database.
- **Quarkus Backend**: The application server processing chat requests and leverages retrieval techniques.

The repository contains SQL scripts (`dump.sql` in the `postgres` folder) to initialize the database schema and seed data. These scripts are executed only when the database volume is empty.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-retrieval.git
cd knowledge-retrieval
```

### 2. Start the Services
Located in the root directory of the repository, execute the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
